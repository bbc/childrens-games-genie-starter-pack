# Stats

Stats are handled by the [GMI](gmi.md) only. Any function that sends stats must have visibility of the GMI.

## Sending Statistics

Statistics consist of key-value pairs called labels that are sent on certain events.

To send a statistic:

```javascript
import { gmi } from "../node_modules/genie/src/core/gmi/gmi.js";
gmi.sendStatsEvent(actionName, actionType, additionalLabels);
```

where `actionName` is the key, `actionType` is the value, and `additionalLabels` are any other key-value pairs to send.

An event is by default considered a page view, unless a specific label signifying a hidden event is present in the measurement call. 'Hidden events' are measurement calls that contain the label `ns_type=hidden` and must be present on all hidden event measurement calls. These are used to capture actions within a page (e.g. click of a button, interaction with a photo gallery, etc.)

## Counternames

Ensure the in-game counter names follow the following format:

```javascript
<product>.games.<game name>.page
```
It is essential that countername starts with either `cbbc.games` or `cbeebies.games` in order for the stats to fire into the correct virtual site.

The in-game countername must match the game page countername to avoid duplication in reporting.

Example counternames:
```javascript
Danger Mouse Game - cbbc.games.danger_mouse_game.page
Go Jetters Jigsaw - cbeebies.games.go_jetters_jigsaw.page
```

## What can we measure?

| Standard Data Items        | Bespoke Data items |
| ------------- |:-----:|
| *Some or all of the following items may be used, and will typically be included  per day, per week, or for the total life of the game so far:*| *These might include:* |
| Unique browsers      | Death co-ordinates |
| Visits     | Scores|
| Page views | Achievement details |
| Time periods (hours, weeks, weekends etc)     | Character customisation selections |
| Total dwell time     | Shop interactions |
| Average dwell time per browser | Button/link clicks e.g. skip level |
| Average dwell time per visit     | Average dwell time per named level |
| Average first visit dwell time     |  |
| Visits per browser    | *See below for custom events and labels relating to these* |
| Browsers per visits (segmented)    | |
| New/returning browsers |  |
| Cohorts (e.g. browsers who did x) |  |
| Sticky factor (likelihood of return within a period) |  |

## Basics

Games tracking consists of action names, action types and labels.

| Action_name        | Description |
| ------------- |:-----:|
| game_click| relates to any subsequent click action taken by the user |
| game_first_click      | relates only to the first click action taken by the user |
| game_level    | relates to level activity e.g. starting, completing, replaying, achievements |
| game_loaded | fires when the game has loaded |
| Timer     | relates to the heartbeat timer |

## Mandatory events and labels

There are some events that are common across ALL games. They have already been implemented for you in Genie, so you will not need to implement them yourself.

### Mandatory to every event

The labels below are sent through with *every* event, the values should be appropriate to the product:

|        |  |
| ------------- |:-----:|
| name| *product*.games.*game name*.page |
| app_name| cbbc, cbeebies |
| app_type| responsive, app |

### Mandatory to every game

These events already occur in Genie:

| Mandatory Event Description | Action Name | Action Type | Additional Labels (in addition to Mandatory, see below) | Available Values (in addition to Mandatory, see below) | Notes |
| ------------- |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Fires when users make their first choice from the homescreen | game_first_click | e.g. play, settings, how_to_play, pause, restart, menu|
| Fires when users make a choice from the gel menu | game_click | e.g. play, settings, how_to_play | game_screen, settings_changed | home, menu, level name, paused, audio-false-difficulty-hard | The action_type should reflect what the user clicks on. May not all be applicable to every game. To understand which game screen the gel button is accessed from. When a user exits the settings menu, we should send a list of key value pairs of the settings items that have changed, or send a value of 'none' if no settings have been changed. We will only send changed items, not all settings values. Ideally, would be in the format audio:false,motion:true,subtitles:false,difficulty:hard but we have encountered errors when using : and , delimiters on web due to old version of echo so have switched these to - for now.|
| Fires when the game has finished loading | game_loaded | true, false |
| Fires every 15 seconds that the user is in the game | timer | heartbeat, game_screen | 15 - home, menu, level name, paused | To understand how long browsers are spending within the game and to allow this to be broken down by screen/level. |

### Mandatory Labels

These should be sent with every event:

| Mandatory Additional Labels | Available Values | Notes |
| ------------- |:-----:|:-----:|
| game_template | gcountdown (IVOR), make_a_picture, jigsaw | where applicable|
| game_level_name | level name, null | |
| game_level_type | whackamole, selecttoprogress, dressup, catchingtargets, paintreveal, null | *mandatory for IVORs only* |
| settings_status | audio-true-motion-true-subtitles-false-difficulty-auto | On any event sent from the game, we should send an additional label that specifies the full list of current settings options. Ideally, would be in the format audio:false,motion:true,subtitles:false,difficulty:hard but we have encountered errors when using : and , delimiters on web due to old version of echo so have switched these to - for now.|

## Common Events and Labels

The following events are common to most games, and you may need to implement some of these yourself. In addition to the mandatory labels outlined above, they may have additional specific labels (depending on the game).

| Description | Action Name | Action Type | Additional Labels (in addition to Mandatory, see below) | Available Values (in addition to Mandatory, see below) |
| ------------- |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Fires when a level is selected from the menu | game_level | selected |
| Fires when a level has loaded and gameplay can commence | game_level | started |
| Fires when a level is completed **(this exists already in Genie)** | game_level | complete | game_score,  game_level_time. stars_awarded, game_level_result |
| Fires when continue button is clicked having completed a level **(this exists already in Genie)** | game_level | continue |
| Fires when play again is clicked having completed a level **(this exists already in Genie)** | game_level | playagain |
| Fires when an interactive element (incidental) is interacted with | game_click | interaction | game_interaction | *interaction name* |

## Custom Events & Labels

These events may be used in a game, where relevant. Examples shown have been used previously. Additional bespoke custom events may need to be created for some games, in which case they should follow the format of the existing events.

*Note - There will be label variations in games developed before common labels were standardised. The relevant DAx_Stats_Integration file (saved in the game's Dropbox folder) should be consulted to confirm a specific game's stats, or failing that, [iStats plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dax-istats-log/jgkkagdpkhpdpddcegfcahbakhefbbga).*

| Description | Action Name | Action Type | Additional Labels | Lebel Values | Notes |
| ------------- |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Fires with each event | |  | game_play_count | number of times game attempted | To enable reports to be sliced by number of plays e.g. what do players typically do on their 2nd play? |
| Fires when an item is selected e.g. customisation | game_click | selected | item_name | descriptive values |  |
| Fires when character customisation is complete | game_click | customised | game_customisation (or more specific details: e.g. face_type, hair_colour etc) | descriptive values | Pass through labels to describe how a character has been customised - which variants have been selected |
| Fires when an item is bought from a shop | game_click | purchased | game_purchase (or more specific details: e.g. item_name, item_cost) | descriptive value | Pass through labels to describe what has been bought |
| Fires when an achievement is awarded | game_level | achievement | achievement | descriptive value, daily_reward |  |
| Fires when a sub-menu is viewed | game_click | viewed | submenu | descriptive name e.g. achievements |
| Fires when an achievement is awarded | game_level | achievement | achievement | descriptive value, daily_reward |
| Fires when a player "dies" | game_level | gameover | x_coordinate, y_coordinate | x_coordinate, y_coordinate | Record coordinates of the position in the game where the player "dies" |
| Fires when a player has to make a decision | game_level | decision | game_decision, game_decision_result | decision name, true,  false, *custom* | Records points at which players are asked to make a decision and the outcomes. Name is optional, used when multiple decisions may be made with similar outcomes. |

## iStats Chrome plug-in

This extension logs calls to iStats to help find out what information is being sent to this service. It features white and blacklisting, as well as label filtering, so tracking down the label in the stat you're looking for is easier.

You can download it from the Chrome store here - [iStats plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dax-istats-log/jgkkagdpkhpdpddcegfcahbakhefbbga).
