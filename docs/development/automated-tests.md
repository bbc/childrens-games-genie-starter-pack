# Automated Tests

## Automated test pack for Genie

The BBC has developed an automated test pack which is used to ensure the game meets some of our technical requirements and the main paths through the game are not broken in order to help reduce the time it takes Genie games to pass certification. The test pack will be executed when the release candidate build of the game component is handed over for certification; A list of test coverage can be found below. It is worth noting that the achievements component is configurable, and although there are tests around achievements listed below. If achievements are not part of the game component these tests will be de-scoped - similary for any custom settings.

## Breaking changes to avoid

The automated framework has been developed to test any of the flows / buttons which come bundled with the Genie-starter-pack. Therefore removing any of these elements, changing their IDs in the DOM or changing the name of the components throughout genie will cause the automated framework to fail. Examples of this are as follows;

Changing the name of the `home` component to `title`. Any elements within this component will therefore have their Ids changed. For instance the play button would change from `home__play` to `title__play` in the DOM. As the automated framework is searching to find an element with the Id `home__play`, almost every test in the automated pack would fail as the play button on the title screen is necessary to test almost all of the flows through the game.

Changing the Id of a specific button. The `how-to-play` button for instance is present on multiple components within genie. If this was therefor to be changed to something other than `how-to-play` e.g. `howToPlay`, any tests which need to interact with this element on any component will fail.
